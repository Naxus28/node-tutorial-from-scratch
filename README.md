# process

The process object allows you to interact with the terminal window
through the 'argv' property, which is an array of the arguments used on the terminal

For instance, when you run a file using the command 'node someFile', the first element in the arg array is the path to the 'node' command (the binary file) and the second is the path to 'someFile'.
