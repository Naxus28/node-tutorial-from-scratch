Express is the most popular nodejs framework for building web servers. Here we serve static files as well as json via get a request handler when users hit a specific route as well as we handle post and delete requests.

Here we have a client face app and a server to demo how to post and delete data. We also take a brief look at some middleware such as `bodyParser` and `cors`.
