# process.stdin and process.stdout

process.stdin and process.stdout allow us to interact with the process while it is running 
 • process.stdin allows you to get arguments from the terminal and 
 act on it via a callback function (if you want your program to 'respond'
 to a user based on the user input, for instance)
 • process.stdout lets out write to the terminal from your program
