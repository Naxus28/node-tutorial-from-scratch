# Http [https://nodejs.org/api/http.html](), [https://nodejs.org/api/https.html](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html)

"The HTTP interfaces in Node.js are designed to support many features of the protocol which have been traditionally difficult to use. In particular, large, possibly chunk-encoded, messages. The interface is careful to never buffer entire requests or responses â€” the user is able to stream data."

Node provides the http module and the https module, to create secure servers. When working with the https module we need to provide the ssl certificate ourselves.

The code one would write to handle http and https operations in node is virtually the same.

In these lessons we build the servers manually. Since we are doing everything manually using the `http` module, these servers are not very robust (they could be but that would require some amount of extra work). However, these are good lessons that help us understand how the `http` module works. Once we start using the `express` module it will be easy to see how it makes use of the `http` module under the hood.
